When I am editing code, I will handle the part about running the server and client. Do not start up the server or client automatically. I will run the server and client manually when I am ready to test the code.

The server is configured to run on port 5002, and the client uses port 9000. The `vite.config.ts` file is set up to proxy API requests to the server.
