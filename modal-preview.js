console.log('=====================================')

console.log('\nðŸ“Š MAIN DIFFICULTY SETUP:')
console.log('- Clean, simple interface with basic CPU performance info')
console.log('- Shows: "Expected CPU Speed: 12s (Fast)" for difficulty 3')
console.log('- Has a "Detailed Analysis" button for power users')

console.log('\nðŸ”¬ DETAILED ANALYSIS MODAL FEATURES:')
console.log('1. Interactive Controls:')
console.log('   - Difficulty slider (1-8)')
console.log('   - Sets on board slider (1-6)')
console.log('   - Real-time updates as user adjusts')

console.log('\n2. Current Analysis Panel:')
console.log('   - Time per attempt (e.g., 1.6s)')
console.log('   - Average attempts needed (e.g., 7.2)')
console.log('   - Total average time (e.g., 12s)')
console.log('   - Typical time range (e.g., 3s-16s)')

console.log('\n3. Performance Matrix Table:')
console.log('   - Shows how difficulty affects all set scenarios (1-6 sets)')
console.log('   - Columns: Sets, Avg Attempts, Time/Attempt, Total Time, Range')
console.log('   - User can see exactly how board complexity affects CPU')

console.log('\n4. Detailed Statistics:')
console.log('   - Attempt distribution (median, percentiles)')
console.log('   - Performance insights (best/worst case)')
console.log('   - Explanation of CPU strategy')

console.log('\n5. Educational Content:')
console.log('   - Explains how the CPU works (random 2-card selection)')
console.log('   - Shows mathematical basis for the timing')
console.log('   - Based on 1000-trial simulations')

console.log('\nðŸ’¡ USER EXPERIENCE:')
console.log('- Casual users: See simple "12s (Fast)" in main interface')
console.log('- Power users: Click "Detailed Analysis" for full breakdown')
console.log('- Interactive exploration of different scenarios')
console.log('- No clutter in main difficulty selection')

console.log('\nðŸŽ¯ EXAMPLE USER JOURNEY:')
console.log('1. User sees "Expected CPU Speed: 35s (Moderate)" for difficulty 1')
console.log('2. Clicks "Detailed Analysis" to understand why')
console.log('3. Sees CPU attempts every 4.8s, needs 7.2 attempts average')
console.log('4. Adjusts "Sets on Board" to 1 â†’ sees time jumps to 1m 45s')
console.log('5. Adjusts "Sets on Board" to 6 â†’ sees time drops to 17s')
console.log('6. Understands: fewer sets = much harder for CPU')
console.log('7. Chooses difficulty based on desired challenge level')

console.log('\nâœ¨ The modal gives users complete control and understanding!')
