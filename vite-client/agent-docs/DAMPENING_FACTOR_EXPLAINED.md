# Dynamic CPU Timing with Dampening Factor

## The Problem with Full Correction

The initial dynamic timing implementation fully corrected for set count differences, making all scenarios take exactly the same total time. While this solved the fairness issue, it created a new problem:

- **Too Artificial**: All board states felt identical
- **Lost Natural Difficulty**: No variation in challenge level
- **Over-Corrected**: Removed the inherent game mechanic where fewer sets should be harder

## The Dampening Solution

### Implementation

```typescript
const rawAdjustmentFactor = currentAttempts / baselineAttempts
const dampening = 0.6 // Apply 60% of the calculated adjustment
const adjustmentFactor = 1 + (rawAdjustmentFactor - 1) * dampening
```

### How Dampening Works

- **60% Correction**: Applies 60% of the calculated adjustment
- **40% Natural**: Preserves 40% of the original difficulty variance
- **Balanced**: Reduces extreme cases while maintaining game feel

## Expected Results (Difficulty 3 with 60% Dampening)

| Sets | Total Time | vs Baseline | Feel                 |
| ---- | ---------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| 1    | ~28s       | +8s harder  | Challenging but fair |
| 2    | ~22s       | +2s harder  | Slightly harder      |
| 3    | ~20s       | baseline    | Normal               |
| 4    | ~18s       | -2s easier  | Slightly easier      |
| 5    | ~17s       | -3s easier  | Easier               |
| 6    | ~15s       | -5s easier  | Much easier          |

## Benefits of Dampening

✅ **Natural Feel**: Preserves the game's inherent difficulty curve
✅ **Reduced Extremes**: Eliminates unfair scenarios without over-correcting
✅ **Balanced**: 1-set scenarios are harder but not impossible
✅ **Predictable**: 6-set scenarios are easier but not trivial
✅ **Tunable**: Dampening factor can be adjusted based on player feedback

## Dampening Factor Options

- **0.0**: No adjustment (original system with extreme variance)
- **0.3**: Light dampening (more natural, less balanced)
- **0.6**: Medium dampening (current - good balance)
- **0.8**: Heavy dampening (more balanced, less natural)
- **1.0**: Full correction (all times equal - too artificial)

The 60% dampening provides the sweet spot between fairness and natural game feel.
