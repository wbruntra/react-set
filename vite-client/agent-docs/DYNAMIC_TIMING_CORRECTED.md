# ðŸ”§ Dynamic CPU Timing - CORRECTED Logic

## The Fix Applied

**Problem**: The original implementation had backwards logic - CPU was slower when fewer sets (should be faster) and faster when more sets (should be slower).

**Solution**: Changed the adjustment factor from `baselineAttempts / currentAttempts` to `currentAttempts / baselineAttempts`.

## How It Now Works (Correctly)

### Logic Chain:

1. **Fewer sets** â†’ **More attempts needed** â†’ **Higher adjustment factor** â†’ **Higher difficulty** â†’ **FASTER intervals**
2. **More sets** â†’ **Fewer attempts needed** â†’ **Lower adjustment factor** â†’ **Lower difficulty** â†’ **SLOWER intervals**

### Expected Results (Difficulty 2):

- **1 set**: ~21.9 attempts needed â†’ Factor: 3.05 â†’ CPU attempts every ~1.6s âœ… FAST
- **2 sets**: ~10.3 attempts needed â†’ Factor: 1.43 â†’ CPU attempts every ~3.4s âœ… FASTER
- **3 sets**: ~7.2 attempts needed â†’ Factor: 1.00 â†’ CPU attempts every ~4.8s âœ… BASELINE
- **4 sets**: ~5.4 attempts needed â†’ Factor: 0.75 â†’ CPU attempts every ~6.4s âœ… SLOWER
- **5 sets**: ~4.5 attempts needed â†’ Factor: 0.63 â†’ CPU attempts every ~7.6s âœ… SLOWER
- **6 sets**: ~3.5 attempts needed â†’ Factor: 0.49 â†’ CPU attempts every ~8.0s âœ… SLOWEST

## Why This Makes Sense

**Before Fix**:

- 1 set = 8.0s per attempt (painfully slow when already hard to find)
- 6 sets = 1.7s per attempt (unfairly fast when easy to find)

**After Fix**:

- 1 set = ~1.6s per attempt (compensates for difficulty of finding)
- 6 sets = ~8.0s per attempt (prevents CPU from being too easy)

## User Experience Impact

âœ… **Consistent Challenge**: Game difficulty now feels similar regardless of random board state
âœ… **Balanced**: No more "impossible when 1 set" or "CPU too fast when many sets"  
âœ… **Adaptive**: Automatically adjusts in real-time as board changes
âœ… **Fair**: CPU speed now compensates for board complexity rather than amplifying it

The corrected logic ensures that the CPU's speed acts as a balancing mechanism, making hard situations more manageable and preventing easy situations from being too trivial.
