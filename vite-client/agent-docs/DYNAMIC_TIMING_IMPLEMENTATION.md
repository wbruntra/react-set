# Dynamic CPU Timing Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a dynamic CPU timing system that adjusts the CPU's response speed based on the number of sets currently on the board. This addresses the issue where having consistent time between guesses made the game too easy with few sets and too hard with many sets.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. New Dynamic Timing Function (`cpuPerformance.ts`)

- Added `calculateDynamicCPUInterval()` function
- Uses the existing performance data to calculate adjustment factors
- When fewer sets available (harder to find): CPU attempts faster
- When more sets available (easier to find): CPU attempts slower
- Maintains reasonable bounds (0.5s - 8s per attempt)

### 2. Updated CPU Timer Logic (`hooks.ts`)

- Modified `startCpuTimer()` to use dynamic timing based on current board state
- Imports `countSets` and `calculateDynamicCPUInterval`
- Calculates timing on each timer start based on actual board conditions

### 3. Enhanced Game State Management (`useSoloGame.ts`)

- Updated CPU timer effect dependencies to include `state.board`
- Timer now recalculates when board changes (after sets are found/removed)
- Ensures timing stays adaptive throughout the game

### 4. Improved User Interface (`DifficultySetup.tsx`)

- Updated CPU performance display to show adaptive timing
- Shows timing examples for different scenarios (few/normal/many sets)
- Updated description to reflect dynamic nature

### 5. Enhanced Analysis Modal (`CPUAnalysisModal.tsx`)

- Updated to show dynamic timing calculations
- Performance matrix now compares baseline vs dynamic timing
- Added explanation of how dynamic timing works
- Shows improvement/change for each scenario

## Technical Details

### Algorithm

The dynamic adjustment uses the baseline performance data:

- 3 sets = baseline (7.19 avg attempts)
- Adjustment factor = baseline_attempts / current_attempts
- Applied to difficulty: adjusted_difficulty = base_difficulty × adjustment_factor

### Examples (Difficulty 3)

- 1 set: 21.85 attempts needed → CPU faster (shorter intervals)
- 3 sets: 7.19 attempts needed → Normal timing (baseline)
- 6 sets: 3.51 attempts needed → CPU slower (longer intervals)

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Challenge**: Similar difficulty regardless of board state
2. **Better Balance**: Addresses the "too easy/too hard" issue
3. **Adaptive**: Automatically adjusts to game conditions
4. **Transparent**: Users can see how timing adapts in the analysis modal

## Files Modified

- `vite-client/src/components/Solo/cpuPerformance.ts` - Added dynamic timing function
- `vite-client/src/components/Solo/hooks.ts` - Updated CPU timer logic
- `vite-client/src/components/Solo/useSoloGame.ts` - Enhanced state management
- `vite-client/src/components/Solo/DifficultySetup.tsx` - Updated UI display
- `vite-client/src/components/Solo/CPUAnalysisModal.tsx` - Enhanced analysis view

## Testing

The system has been designed to:

- Speed up CPU when 1-2 sets are on the board (making it more reasonable)
- Slow down CPU when 4-6 sets are on the board (preventing it from being too easy)
- Maintain similar timing for 3 sets (the baseline)

This creates a much more balanced and enjoyable gaming experience where the challenge remains consistent regardless of the random board conditions.
